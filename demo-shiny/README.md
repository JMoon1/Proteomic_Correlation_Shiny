This is the Shiny app created in the Hackathon to demo new features to potentially merge with the old Shiny app (`Proteomic_Correlation_Shiny/DepLab/inst/shiny/`)

Files:
- `app.R`: The main Shiny app, run this from RStudio or with `runApp()` from R in this dir
- `demo-data.R`: Script that sets up the data and plots to be used in the app
- `user_settings_io.R`: Shiny module for the user's RDS file settings import/export
