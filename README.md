Tools for the analysis of protein correlation profiling data
=================================================================

The goal is to create tools to handle data that is generated by protein correlation profiling data.

At the moment, this entails two main tasks:

1. A [Shiny app](#shiny-app) for data wrangling and visual exploration
2. Developing functions for [statistical analyses](#statistical-analyses)

The DepLab package that has been developed by the Applied Bioinformatics Core at Weill Cornell Medicine will serve as a starting point.

## Shiny app

The DepLab package contains a shiny app that allows for:

* upload of PCP data into a data base
* smoothening of the data
* visual exploration of individual protein profiles

More details can be found in the manual.

There are numerous tasks that can be done to tremendously improve the app (it may also be written completely new from scratch) and we may come up with more things during the hackathon!

- [ ] interactive graphics (perhaps via `plotly`?)
- [ ] additional plots, e.g. histograms of QC values to allow for user-defined filtering
- [ ] once a user saves a plot, can there be a log file that contains the details (e.g., what data set with which filtering settings etc.?)
- [ ] connection to String, Pfam and other protein interaction portals
